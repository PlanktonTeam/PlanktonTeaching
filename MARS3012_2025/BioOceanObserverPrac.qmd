# IMOS National Reference Stations

<img src="PNGs/NRS.png" width="400px" style="float:left"/>

The [Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS)](https://imos.org.au) is a national ocean observing system measuring the physical, chemical and biological environment. It is one of the national research infrastructure capabilities currently supported under the Australian Government’s National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). IMOS has been awarded \$144M of Australian Government funding over 10 years (2006-2016), with matching co-investment of \$200M. Plankton observations within IMOS are provided by the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder survey (AusCPR) and the National Reference Stations (NRS) program (Davies et al. 2014).

The IMOS [National Reference Stations](https://imos.org.au/facility/national-mooring-network/national-reference-stations) collect observations of both physical and biogeochemical variables to characterise the ocean environment and to understand fundamental biological processes within the environment. Core variables observed include temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, turbidity, carbon, phytoplankton, and zooplankton.

The vessel-based sampling comprises: 

1) Vertical profiling sensor measurements of conductivity (salinity), temperature and depth, oxygen, fluorometry and turbidity; 

1) Niskin bottle samples at discrete 10 m intervals for measurements of total dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity and nutrients; 

1) A sample from surface Niskin bottles for phytoplankton and pigments; 

1) Zooplankton samples from a plankton drop net; 

1) Measurement of turbidity with a Secchi disk; and 

1) Some station-specific samples (i.e. Larval Fish)

More information about the network, and how it was setup can be found in this [PloS ONE article](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113652).

As scientists, Claire and I are particularly interested in the state and trends of the phytoplankton and zooplankton, but we use the physical and chemical observations to interpret the plankton. <br>

# Why is plankton important?

Plankton dominates the biomass of marine systems. Each day, phytoplankton perform nearly half of the photosynthesis on Earth, mixing 100 million tons of carbon dioxide and producing half of the oxygen we breathe. The most common zooplankton, the copepods, are the most abundant animals on Earth, even outnumbering insects (Schminke 2006). The carrying capacity of marine systems – the biomass of exploited fish, squid and shellfish, the numbers of charismatic marine mammals, seabirds and sea turtles, and the diverse bottom-dwelling communities of crabs and fish – are determined by the biomass, growth, timing, and composition of the plankton.

Plankton impacts human health. Some phytoplankton species produce toxins and form large harmful algal blooms or red tides, which can contaminate shellfish and cause a suite of poisoning syndromes and death in humans. Some zooplankton are venomous, such as the box jellyfish *Chironex fleckeri* and Irukandji species, which close beaches in northern Australia and can cause severe pain and death.

Plankton infuence the pace and extent of climate change. Plankton shunts carbon from the surface to the deep ocean by fixing carbon through photosynthesis. This carbon is transferred to zooplankton grazers, sinking to the ocean floor as faeces or dead carcasses, where it can be removed from the atmosphere for thousands to millions of years – a process known as the biological pump. The type of phytoplankton present can have a significant influence on the efficiency of carbon export, as larger species sink more quickly. Movement of carbon to the deep ocean by plankton has contributed to the ocean uptake of 40% of the carbon dioxide produced by people – it would be much warmer if this carbon had not been taken up by the ocean. Over geological time, the accumulation of carbon from plankton on the sea floor has formed the oil and natural gas deposits we use today.

Without plankton, the Earth would have 50% less oxygen, be warmer and devoid of large fish and charismatic animals. In fact, much of the economic value of the oceans, estimated at US\$21 trillion per annum and similar to the global gross national product (Costanza et al. 1997), is provided by plankton through fishery production, nutrient cycling, gas production and climate regulation. The collapse of plankton populations would lead to a catastrophic disruption of marine ecosystems and have devastating consequences for marine life and human food supplies.


# The Biological Ocean Observer

<img src="PNGs/BOO_Screenshot.png" width="600px" style="float:left; margin: 10px;"/>

The [Biological Ocean Observer](https://shiny.csiro.au/BioOceanObserver/) is an open-source tool built in R and Shiny by Jason Everett and Claire Davies. 

Its goal is to Integrate, Analyse and Visualise data collected by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS). It aims to enhance the availability and understanding of biological data and make it accessible to broader and non-specialist audiences in order to accelerate the next generation of scientific insights. 

Under the hood, the Biological Ocean Observer is powered by the R package _planktonr_. This means that all visualisation and analysis undertaken within the Biolgical Ocean Observer can also be completed offline in R. This gives extra power to skilled users who wish to update plots or further wrangle datasets in ways not possibly within the Shiny App. Besides students and scientists, one key audience of this tool is policy makers and managers at local, state and national levels. The outputs from the Biological Ocean Observer have already been used in National and State based environmental reporting such as the State of the Environment. 

## Practical Questions
In today's practical we will explore trends and patterns in the oceans around Australia using the Biological Ocean Observer. We have provided a number of small tasks to guide your exploration of the Biological Ocean Observer, and in the process, your understanding of various dynamics.

Today is intended to be an interactive learning experience, so please chat amongst your desk, ask questions of your teachers and please let us know if you find interesting relationships and phenomena. We are all learning here. 

1)  First switch to the `Phytoplankton Tab`. Select the `Phytoplankton Abundance` variable. What is the long-term trend at `North Stradbroke Island`, `Port Hacking` and `Maria Island`? It might be easier to visualise if you change the axes to log10. Is the trend significant?

::: {.callout-note title="Statistical Significance"}
The statistical significance of the annual trend from a linear model of form _lm(Values ~ Year + harmonic(Month, k = 1)_ is shown in brackets above each plot. 
:::

2) Change the variable to `Phytoplankton Biomass`. Does the trend change? Why might the abundance and biomass be the same or different? What are the implications of this?

1) Consider the seasonal trend on the right. Given that the plots are ordered by latitude (North Stradbroke to the north, and Maria Island in the south) consider how seasonality changes with latitude. Does this make sense from what what discussed today? If not, what other reasons can you come up with for the difference in patterns?

1) Switching to the `Zooplankton Tab`, lets look at species diversity. The copepods are the group of zooplankton that we can most reliably identify to species, hence we use `Copepod Diversity` as a proxy for whole community diversity. How is the `Copepod Diversity` changing over time (at the same stations as above)? Why might this be the case?

1) Has this trend changed over time since IMOS started sampling in 2009? Change the date-slider to show the first 5 years only. Was the trend the same? What about just the last 5 years?

1) Still in the `Zooplankton Tab`, switch to the `Species Information` and compare the distribution of 2 species of Copepod: _Calanus simillimus_ and _Calanus australis_. From their distribution, what can you deduce about their temperature preferences? Have a look at the `Species Temperature Index Graphs` and see if your suspicions are correct. 

1) Do these species exhibit Diel-Vertical Migration? The DVM plots are generated from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) observations. The CPR is towed at 7-10 m depth for multiple-days so species that are observed in higher abundances at night are assumed to be under taking DVM and moving into the surface ocean at night.

1) Now lets look at 3 species of krill: _Euphausia superba_, _Euphausia similis_ and _Euphausia recurva_. Unfortunately we don't have enough information to calculate their Species Temperature Index plots, but what can you deduce about their temperature preferences from their distributions? 

1) In the `Environmental Data Tab`, go to the `Biogeochemistry` and select `Maria Island` and `DIN`. This is the Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen. When do nutrients start accumulating in the water column? Now go back to the `Phytoplankton Tab` and look at the seasonal cycle of `Phytoplankton Abundance` or `Phytoplankton Biomass`. What do you notice about the blooms in phytoplankton? Can you explain this given what you have learnt today about seasonality in sub-tropical and temperate regions?

1) Using the `Relationships Tab`, can you show a relationship between `Phytoplankton Biomass` and `Zooplankton Biomass` at `North Stradbroke Island`? Is this what you expect?

1) We are often told there is higher diversity in warmer water. Have a look at `Copepod Diversity` against `Temperature` at `Maria Island` (a temperate site) and `North Stradbroke Island` (a sub-tropical site). What do you see?

Now that you have a good feel for what is available in the Biological Ocean Observer, keep exploring. What questions interest you? Can you find the data within the Biological Ocean Observer to support your inquiries?

::: {.callout-note title="Spatial Context"}
If you find something interesting in your exploration of the Biological Ocean Observer, you might like to examine the spatial context. For example, was a particularly cold point in the timeseries a result of a broader upwelling event? To do this, you can go to the [IMOS Ocean Current website](https://oceancurrent.aodn.org.au). Choose the variable you want to look at - generally Temperature or Ocean Colour (Chlorophyll) - and find a map for the corresponding period. Can you line up your observations with the maps?

<!-- [Day 2: State of the Marine Environment - IMOS National Reference Stations]{style="font-size:28px; color:#1162a5ff"} -->

<!-- In this practical we will use the Biological Ocean Observer to explore patterns and trends at the IMOS National Reference Stations. You will then use what you discover to write a short (1 page + figures) report integrating the physical, chemical and biological observations to describe the State of the Marine Environment. -->

<!-- # Eecological indicators -->

<!-- Indicators are simple measures of the state of a system. Plankton provides ideal indicators of ecosystem health and ecological change because it is abundant, short-lived, not harvested, and sensitive to changes in temperature, acidity and nutrients. Plankton has thus been used as indicators for climate change, eutrophication, fisheries, invasive species, ecosystem health and biodiversity (Edwards et al. 2011). Here, we use the term ecological indicator as a measure of ecosystem state without considering a threshold level that triggers management intervention as in fisheries management. -->


<!-- # The State of the Marine Environment -->

<!-- There are many examples of integrated assessments of the environment. These include the National <a href=https://soe.dcceew.gov.au> "State of the Environment"</a> report which is released every 5 years as legislated by The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). Australia's state of the environment 2021 (SoE 2021) assesses the changing condition of our natural environment across 12 themes: air quality, Antarctica, biodiversity, climate, coasts, extreme events, heritage, Indigenous, inland water, land, marine and urban. -->

<!-- State-based reports are also released regularly, including the <a href="https://www.stateoftheenvironment.des.qld.gov.au"> Queensland State of the Environment Report </a>. -->

<!-- A team within IMOS has also produced similar reports including <a href = "https://imos.org.au/fileadmin/user_upload/shared/Data_Tools/15-00245_OA_Plankton2015_20ppBrochure_WEB_151116.pdf"> Plankton 2015 </a> and the <a href = "https://www.imosoceanreport.org.au"> IMOS State and Trends of Australia's Oceans </a>. -->

<!-- Imagine you are a state government official, and you have been asked by your minister to write a 1 page briefing document that describes the current state and trends of the ocean in your state. You know that IMOS has the longest and most consistent time-series of data, so you decide to use the IMOS National Reference Station to base your report on. You know that 1 site can't be representative of the whole region, but it is the best data you have for the moment. -->
